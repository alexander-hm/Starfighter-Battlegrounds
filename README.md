# Starfighter Battlegrounds
## 3D Dogfighting Game (in development)

The game Starfighter Battlegrounds was a personal project I worked on my senior year of high school when I got bored of class and had already submitted my college applications. It is incomplete but showcases a few cool things that I was able to do. 

### Menu
#### Page 1
The menu starts on the main page which displays a title and has a simple "Play" button that takes you to the next page of the menu.
#### Page 2
The next page of the menu features an "Arena" button and a "Shipyard" button. Arena takes you to the gameplay and shipyard was a planned future addition that allows the user to customize their ship, buy upgrades, and see stats.
### Arena (gameplay)
The Arena is the primary gameplay component. Here, the user controls a starfighter in an artificial asteroid field. On start, the player's ship is in the middle of the field and behind a neon pink (for visibility during development) enemy ship. The objective of the game is to shoot down the ship, avoiding collisions with the asteroids. When the enemy ship is shot, the game destroys it. When the player crashes into an asteroid, their ship is destroyed. The gameplay is very limited at this stage. There was an enemy ai that I wrote but it was very finnicky so I took it out for the time being. Crashing into an asteroid ends the game, but destroying the enemy's ship does not.

### Controls
The game is made to run on a mobile device and uses touchscreen controls.
The toggle in the bottom left-hand corner controls the direction of the ship (up, down, left, right).
The toggle in the bottom right-hand corner controls the clockwise and counterclowckwise rotation of the starfighter.
The slider of the right side of the screen controls the speed of the fighter and changes the size of the afterburners in the game.
The button in the middle of the right side of the screen is the "Fire" button and allows the user to shoot neon green lasers/bullets from the ship in the game.
